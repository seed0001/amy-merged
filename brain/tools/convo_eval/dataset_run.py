"""Run a real human dialogue dataset through Adam and sort what goes wrong into edge-case buckets.

Dataset: DailyDialog (roskoN/dailydialog on Hugging Face): everyday two-person conversations, each line
tagged with its act (1 inform, 2 question, 3 directive, 4 commissive) and emotion. Speaker A's lines are
said to Adam, in order, as one conversation; Adam takes speaker B's place. Every reply is checked:

  crash         an exception
  lost          he couldn't make sense of it ("couldn't pin down", "didn't catch", "who do you mean by")
  junk_fact     he stored a fact from a line that isn't a claim (a question, an order, small talk)
  wrong_kind    a question answered with "I've stored...", or a statement answered as a request
  routed        the request matcher re-read the line as something else (listed for review)
  repeat        the same reply twice in a row
  slow          over a second
The report groups the lines in each bucket by how they start, so the patterns that need rules show up
first. Usage:
  python -m tools.convo_eval.dataset_run --download 2000
  python -m tools.convo_eval.dataset_run --dialogues 300
