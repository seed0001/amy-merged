"""Follow-up questions that keep a conversation going. None of them are stock sentences.

After he replies he sometimes asks one question back, chosen by reasoning over what he knows:
  - a gap about someone just mentioned: the relations other people in his memory have (lives in,
    works at, owns, ...) that this person lacks, most common first; the question is realized by
    grammar from that relation ("Where does Howard live?"), and a short answer ("Dayton") is learned;
  - his core question (dialogue.drive): the most informative open hypothesis about being alive or
    conscious, put in a grammatical construction; the answer is stored as that person's stance.
At most one question per reply, a cooldown per person, none in sensitive moments, more when his
curiosity and sociability are high. A reply only counts as an answer if it takes a stance or fills
the slot; anything else is handled as ordinary conversation.
