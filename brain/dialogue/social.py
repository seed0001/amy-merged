"""Social conversation: greetings, goodbyes, thanks, small talk, and questions about the bot itself.

Answers about itself come from three places, never from a fixed persona:
  - what it has been taught about itself (ordinary facts: "You like pizza", "Your favorite color is blue");
  - its state variables (dialogue.self_model) for "how are you?" / "are you tired?";
  - what it can count about itself (facts known, rules, people met, age of its memory).

Wording varies through shuffled phrase decks; the content never does. Each intent has its own
bank of phrasings. Mood and time of day determine the relevant intent, and a deck is exhausted
before its templates repeat.
