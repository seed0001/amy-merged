"""Paragraph planning: turn a one-line reply into developed speech.

Every reply starts from its core (the answer, the acknowledgement, the greeting). The planner then
gathers propositions that are actually supported, ranks them, groups them by topic and realizes them
with grammar, stopping when the evidence runs out. Nothing is a stock sentence:

  paragraph 1  the core, then what else he knows about the people and things in focus, aggregated
               ("I also know Howard owns a red truck and works at a bakery"), and what follows from
               their kinds ("Because Rex is a beagle, Rex is also a hound and a dog").
  paragraph 2  connections and context: others who share something ("Howard and Bob both live in
               Dayton"), what the dictionary says about the kinds involved, who told him.
  paragraph 3  his own angle, grounded in his drive and record, then one question to keep going.
