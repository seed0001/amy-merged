"""Second and third passes for messages the parser couldn't take whole.

Pass 2, what is it: simplify and decompose the sentence, then classify it.
  - drop intensifiers and asides ("very", "really", "right now", "just"), and read "is being X" as "is X";
  - split a conditional into its assumption and its question ("Am I an animal if I'm human?");
  - resolve "that" / "this" to what he just said;
  - notice evaluation: adjectives whose WordNet similarity links lead to good or bad (and right/wrong,
    smart/stupid, helpful/useless, kind/mean), aimed at him or at his last reply;
  - notice questions about the conversation itself ("Do you understand what I said?").
Pass 3, reason over it:
  - a conditional is answered by assuming its premise inside a savepoint, asking, and rolling back, so
    the assumption never becomes a stored fact;
  - feedback moves his state and is answered in terms of what he actually just did;
  - "did you understand" is answered honestly from his last turn;
  - anything still unclear gets a reply tied to the words he does know and to what was just being
    discussed, not a generic request for help.
