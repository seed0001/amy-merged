"""Working out what to ask about the world: what he's interested in, measured against what he knows.

Nothing here is a list of questions. Three things are kept and reasoned over:

  interest   every name or idea gets a weight that grows when people bring it up (more when they ask him
             about it), when he reads about it, and when it's tied to something he already cares about.
             It fades over days, so his interests follow the conversation.
  sightings  where each one came up (a story, a lookup, something someone said) and what came up with it.
  knowledge  his actual memory: does he know what kind of thing it is, what's true of it, how it connects.

From those he generates candidate questions, each from a specific gap:
  kind        he has no idea what it is                      -> "What is Binance?"
  slot        he knows its kind, and other things of that kind have a relation it lacks
                                                             -> "Where is Binance based?" (from the data)
  connection  two things keep coming up together but nothing links them in his memory
                                                             -> "What does North Korea have to do with Binance?"
  detail      he knows what it is but almost nothing else    -> "What should I know about Binance?"
Each is scored by interest x how much the gap blocks him x how well it ties into what he already knows,
less what he's already asked. The best one is asked, and "why do you ask?" gets the reasoning back.
An answer is learned like anything else he's told, which changes his knowledge, which changes the
next question.
