"""When she can't answer, reason out exactly why, and turn that into the one question that gets her the data.

Her job is collecting knowledge, so an unknown answer is an opportunity, not a dead end. For a question
she can't settle, she links together:

  known     what she does know about the subject, preferring facts that bear on the question
  rule      a rule she holds that would decide it, and which of its conditions she can already prove
  gap       the precise condition (or fact) still missing
  ask       a question for exactly that gap

She keeps the open gap per speaker. When a later turn teaches her something, she re-asks the original
question herself, so what she just learned is reused straight away: "That fills the gap: ...".
