"""Definitions he can reason with, not just repeat.

"A birthday is the day someone is born" becomes a rule: someone's birthday is the time of their being born.
Asked "When is your birthday?", he looks for the event in what he's been told ("You were created today"),
and if the event doesn't match the definition exactly he asks whether it counts ("Is being created the same
as being born, for me?") and learns the answer. The date comes from the fact itself: "today" in a fact means
the day it was said. Facts said straight out ("Today is your birthday") are kept too and checked against
the reasoning.
