"""The user guide, worked out per person: what to explain, in what order, and how simply.

The features are data (FEATURES): what each is for, an everyday comparison, the steps, phrasings that
really work, tips, and what you need to know first. Nothing here is a finished answer. For each request
the guide reasons:

  what      which features the question is about, scored by their words; "how do I use you" means all
            of them, as a tour taken one stop at a time
  order     anything a feature depends on that this person hasn't been shown yet comes first
            (the news needs his name, so the wake word is explained before the news)
  level     how simply to put it: 0 = like you're five (comparison, short steps, one thing to try),
            1 = normal, 2 = the details and the catches. Asked for ("explain it like I'm five",
            "more detail"), or worked out: if someone says they're lost, the next try goes simpler
            and leads with the comparison instead of repeating itself
  memory    what each person has been shown and at what level, so the second time is a reminder,
            and "next" carries on the tour
Then it's put into plain sentences, one after another, with a little flavor.
